    "content": "Deep Reinforcement Learning has always fascinated me. The idea that an agent can learn optimal behavior through trial and error, without explicit programming, is truly remarkable.\n\nIn my thesis research, I explored how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) could be applied to solve real-world traffic congestion problems. The challenge was significant: urban traffic systems are complex, dynamic environments with countless variables.\n\n## The Problem\n\nTraditional traffic management systems rely on fixed rules and schedules. They don't adapt to changing conditions in real-time. This leads to inefficient traffic flow, increased congestion, and wasted time for commuters.\n\n## The Solution\n\nI developed an intelligent traffic management system using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The system uses Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) agents to dynamically optimize vehicle speed limits based on real-time traffic conditions.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe DTQN model consistently outperformed traditional algorithms and the baseline DQN by leveraging temporal data to make more adaptive and efficient routing decisions.\n\n## What I Learned\n\nThis project taught me the importance of:\n- Understanding the problem domain deeply\n- Choosing the right architecture for the task\n- Proper evaluation and benchmarking\n- Iterative improvement based on results\n\nThe journey wasn't easy, but the results were worth it. I'm excited to continue exploring how AI can solve real-world problems."
